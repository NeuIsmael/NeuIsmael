- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeuIsmael, I have a bachelor's degree in agronomy at [UFSM - Unversidade Federal de Santa Maria](https://www.ufsm.br/). 
  During my graduation I dedicated myself to studies in the areas of plant genetic improvement and experimental 
  statistics. Further details of my academic life can be seen in the [LATTES profile](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0338625159436618).
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating and learning about genetic improvement and experimental statistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (constantly) the R, python and markdown languages, auxiliary tools for data analysis and
  presentation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on genetic improvement and data analysis projects.
